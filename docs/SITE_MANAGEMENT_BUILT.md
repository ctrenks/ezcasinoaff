## Next Steps

### 1. Create Database Migration ⚠️ REQUIRED

**You must run this before the application will work:**

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_site_management_system
```

This will:

- Create all new tables in your database
- Generate migration files
- Update the Prisma client

### 2. Test Site Creation

After migration:

1. Sign in to your account
2. Go to "My Sites" in navigation
3. Click "Add New Site"
4. Enter a domain (e.g., "test.com")
5. Site will be created with INACTIVE status
6. API key will be generated automatically

### 3. Test Credits System

1. Go to "Credits" in navigation
2. View your balance (starts at 0)
3. See credit packs available
4. Transaction history (empty initially)

## Known Limitations

1. **No Stripe Integration**: Payment processing not implemented
2. **No API Validation**: API keys not validated on public endpoints yet
3. **No Rate Limiting**: Usage tracking exists but not enforced
4. **No Subscription Flow**: Can't actually activate sites yet
5. **No Credit Purchases**: Can't buy credits yet

---

## Future Implementation Priorities

### High Priority (Required for Launch)

1. Stripe integration for subscriptions
2. Subscription activation logic
3. API key validation middleware
4. Site details page with subscription management

### Medium Priority

5. Credit purchase with Stripe
6. Usage statistics and graphs
7. Email notifications
8. Subscription renewal reminders

### Low Priority

9. Admin panel for managing all users/sites
10. Advanced analytics
11. Team accounts
12. Webhook notifications
