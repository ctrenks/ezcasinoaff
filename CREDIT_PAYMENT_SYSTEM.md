## Implementation

### API Endpoint

**`POST /api/credits/pay-with-credits`**

```typescript
{
  type: "subscription" | "credits",
  amount: number,           // Dollar amount
  planType?: string,        // For subscriptions (BASIC/PRO/EVERYTHING)
  creditAmount?: number,    // For credit purchases
  siteId?: string          // For subscriptions (required)
}
```

**Response:**

  creditsUsed: number,
  creditsAdded?: number,        // For credit purchases
  newBalance?: number           // For credit purchases
}
```

### UI Components Updated

1. **`app/pricing/PricingClient.tsx`**

   - Shows credit payment option on pricing page
   - Displays user's credit balance
   - Handles credit payments for both subscriptions and credit packs

2. **`app/profile/sites/SiteSubscriptionModal.tsx`**
   - Shows credit payment option when adding/managing subscriptions
   - Includes balance info per plan
   - Processes credit payments with site-specific context

### Credit Balance Display

Users see their balance in multiple formats:

- **Sufficient balance**: Shows prominent "Pay with X Credits" button
- **Insufficient balance**: Shows balance + "Need X more credits" message
- **No balance**: Button hidden, only PayPal/Crypto options shown

## Usage Flow

### For Subscriptions:

1. User navigates to `/profile/sites` or `/pricing`
2. System fetches their credit balance
3. If balance â‰¥ subscription cost:
   - "ðŸ’Ž Pay with Credits" button appears (gradient purple/indigo)
4. User clicks button
5. Confirmation dialog shows:
   - Plan details
   - Site info (if applicable)
   - Credits to be deducted
6. On confirmation:
   - Credits deducted from balance
   - Subscription created and activated
   - Site status updated to ACTIVE
   - Payment record created
   - Affiliate commission generated (if applicable)
   - User receives notification
7. Page refreshes to show new subscription

### For Credit Purchases:

1. User on `/profile/credits` or `/pricing`
2. System checks if they have enough credits to "buy" more (unusual scenario)
3. If balance â‰¥ pack cost:
   - Credit payment option appears
4. Payment deducts cost, then adds purchased credits
5. Net result: User trades credits for a pack (potentially with bonus)

## Transaction Example

**Scenario**: User buys PRO plan ($199/year) with credits

```
Initial Balance: 500 credits
Plan Cost: $199 = 199 credits

Transaction:
1. Verify: 500 >= 199 âœ“
2. Deduct: 500 - 199 = 301 credits
3. Create subscription (PRO, 1 year)
4. Update site status to ACTIVE
5. Create payment record ($199, SUCCEEDED)
6. Generate commission (if user was referred)
7. Send notification to user
8. Final Balance: 301 credits
```

## Database Records Created

For each credit payment:

1. **RadiumTransaction** (USAGE)

   - Negative amount (credits spent)
   - Description of purchase
   - Updated balance

2. **Payment**

   - Amount in USD

4. **AffiliateCommission** (if applicable)

   - Links to payment and subscription
