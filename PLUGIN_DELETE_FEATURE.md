# Plugin Version Delete Feature

## Overview

Added the ability for super admins to delete uploaded plugin versions from the admin panel.

## What Was Added

### 1. DELETE API Route

**File:** `app/api/admin/plugin-upload/[id]/route.ts`

- **Endpoint:** `DELETE /api/admin/plugin-upload/[id]`
- **Access:** Super admin only (role 5)
- **Functionality:**
  - Validates super admin permissions
  - Finds the plugin version by ID
  - Deletes the file from Vercel Blob storage
  - Removes the database record
  - Returns success/error response

### 2. Plugin Version Table Component

**File:** `app/admin/plugin-upload/PluginVersionTable.tsx`

- Client-side component with delete functionality
- Features:
  - **Two-click confirmation:** First click shows "Confirm Delete?", second click executes
  - **Visual feedback:** Button changes to red on first click
  - **Loading state:** Shows "Deleting..." while processing
  - **Auto-reset:** Confirmation resets after 5 seconds if not confirmed
  - **Error handling:** Displays alerts on failure
  - **Auto-refresh:** Refreshes the page on successful deletion

### 3. Updated Admin Page

**File:** `app/admin/plugin-upload/page.tsx`

- Replaced static table with the new `PluginVersionTable` component
- Maintains all existing functionality
- Adds delete buttons to each row

## User Experience

### Delete Flow:

1. Super admin clicks "Delete" button on a plugin version row
2. Button turns red and changes text to "Confirm Delete?"
3. Admin clicks again within 5 seconds to confirm
4. Button shows "Deleting..." while processing
5. On success:
   - File deleted from Vercel Blob
   - Database record removed
   - Page refreshes to show updated list
6. On error:
   - Alert shows error message
   - Button returns to normal state

### Safety Features:

- ✅ Two-click confirmation prevents accidental deletion
- ✅ Super admin access only
- ✅ 5-second auto-reset of confirmation
- ✅ Visual feedback at each step
- ✅ Error handling and reporting

## API Response Format

### Success Response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Plugin version 1.2.3 deleted successfully"
}
```

### Error Responses:

```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized"  // Not logged in
}

{
  "error": "Forbidden - Super admin access required"  // Not super admin
}

{
  "error": "Plugin version not found"  // Invalid ID
}

{
  "error": "Internal server error"  // Server error
}
```

## Table Structure

The updated table now includes an "Actions" column with delete buttons:

| Version | File              | Size   | Downloads | Uploaded   | By    | Actions  |
| ------- | ----------------- | ------ | --------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| v1.2.3  | radium-plugin.zip | 2.5 MB | 45        | 10/31/2024 | Admin | [Delete] |

## Technical Notes

### Blob Storage Cleanup

- The delete function attempts to remove the file from Vercel Blob
- If blob deletion fails (e.g., file already missing), the database record is still deleted
- This prevents orphaned database records

### Database Transaction

- No explicit transaction needed as only one record is being deleted
- The Prisma delete operation is atomic

### Permission Check

- Validated at both the API route level and UI level
- Only super admins (role 5) can access the admin plugin upload page
- Additional check in the DELETE route for security

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Super admin can see delete buttons
- [ ] Non-admin users cannot access the page
- [ ] First click shows confirmation
- [ ] Second click deletes the version
- [ ] File is removed from Vercel Blob
- [ ] Database record is removed
- [ ] Page refreshes showing updated list

- [ ] Error messages display correctly
- [ ] Multiple simultaneous deletes don't cause issues

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

- Bulk delete functionality
- Restore deleted versions (soft delete)
- Delete confirmation modal instead of two-click
- Admin activity log for deletions
- Download statistics preservation after deletion
