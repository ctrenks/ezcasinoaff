## What's Left for Radium Credits

The Radium Credit system is **still operational** but needs its own dedicated UI:

### Recommended Next Steps (Optional)
1. Create `/profile/radium` page for Radium Credit management
2. Create purchase flow for Radium Credits (separate from EZ Credits)
3. Update `CREDIT_PACKS` or create new `RADIUM_PACKS` with $3-4 pricing
4. Create conversion UI: "Convert 4 EZ Credits â†’ 1 Radium Credit"
5. Admin UI to manually adjust Radium Credits (already exists at `/admin/credits`)
