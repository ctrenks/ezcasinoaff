# Dual Credit System

## Overview

The platform now has **two separate credit systems** with distinct purposes:

### 1. **User Credits** (Payment Currency)

- **Ratio**: 1 User Credit = $1 USD
- **Uses**:
  - Pay for site subscriptions
  - Purchase more User Credits
  - General payment currency

### 2. **Radium Credits** (AI Review Generation)

- **Purpose**: Credits for generating AI casino/game reviews
- **Cost**: ~$3-4 per Radium Credit (approximately 4 User Credits = 1 Radium Credit)
- **Uses**:
  - Generate casino reviews
  - Generate game reviews
  - AI content generation

  userId          String
  type            UserCreditTransactionType

## API Changes Needed

### Current APIs Using "Credits" (Need Update)

1. **`/api/credits`** â†’ Rename to `/api/user-credits`

   - Returns User Credit balance
   - Returns User Credit transactions

2. **`/api/credits/transactions`** â†’ `/api/user-credits/transactions`

   - User Credit transaction history

3. **`/api/credits/pay-with-credits`** â†’ `/api/user-credits/pay`

   - Pay for subscriptions/services with User Credits

4. **Create `/api/radium-credits`**

   - Returns Radium Credit balance
   - Returns Radium Credit transactions

5. **Create `/api/radium-credits/purchase`**

   - Purchase Radium Credits with money or User Credits

6. **Create `/api/radium-credits/use`**
   - Use Radium Credit for AI generation
   - Log which site/casino/game

### Admin APIs

1. **`/api/admin/credits/manual-adjust`** â†’ Keep name, add type param
   - Add `type: "user" | "radium"` parameter
   - Adjust either User Credits or Radium Credits

## UI Components to Update

### `/profile/credits` Page

**Rename to:** `/profile/user-credits`

- Show User Credit balance
- Purchase User Credit packs
- Transaction history

### Create: `/profile/radium-credits` Page

- Show Radium Credit balance
- Purchase Radium Credit packs
- Transaction history with site details
- "Generate Review" button

### Navigation Updates

```tsx
<Link href="/profile/user-credits">
  <span>ðŸ’°</span> User Credits
</Link>
<Link href="/profile/radium-credits">
  <span>ðŸ¤–</span> Radium Credits
</Link>
```

### Admin Dashboard Stats

```tsx
{
  title: "User Credits in Circulation",
  value: totalUserCredits,
},
{
  title: "Radium Credits in Circulation",
  value: totalRadiumCredits,
}
```

## Migration Steps

### 1. Database Migration

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_user_credits
```

This will:

- Create `UserCredit` and `UserCreditTransaction` tables
- Keep existing `RadiumCredit` and `RadiumTransaction` tables
- Add new `USER_CREDITS` payment type

### 2. Data Migration Script

**Option A**: Keep existing data as User Credits

```sql
-- Copy RadiumCredit to UserCredit for all users
INSERT INTO "UserCredit" (id, userId, balance, lifetime, createdAt, updatedAt)
SELECT gen_random_uuid(), userId, balance, lifetime, createdAt, updatedAt
FROM "RadiumCredit";

-- Reset RadiumCredit balances to 0
UPDATE "RadiumCredit" SET balance = 0, lifetime = 0;
```

**Option B**: Fresh start (recommended if no users yet)

- Create UserCredit records as users sign up
- Keep RadiumCredit at 0 until purchased

### 3. Code Updates Priority

**High Priority (Breaking Changes)**:

1. âœ… Update `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. Create `/api/user-credits` endpoints
3. Update payment flows to use UserCredit
4. Update admin manual adjustment to support both types

**Medium Priority (Feature Completion)**:

1. Create Radium Credit purchase flow
2. Create Radium usage API for review generation
3. Update UI to show both credit types
4. Create separate credit pages

**Low Priority (Polish)**:

1. Update documentation
2. Add credit conversion calculator
3. Create credit pack recommendations
4. Add low-balance warnings

## Benefits of Dual System

### For Users:

- ðŸ’° **Flexible spending**: User Credits for everything
- ðŸ¤– **Specialized tool**: Radium for AI reviews
- ðŸ“Š **Clear tracking**: Separate balances prevent confusion
- ðŸ’µ **Bulk discounts**: Better rates when buying Radium in bulk

### For Platform:

- ðŸ’¼ **Revenue streams**: Two products to sell
- ðŸ“ˆ **Higher value**: Radium Credits cost more per unit
- ðŸ”’ **Locked-in value**: Credits create platform stickiness
- ðŸ“Š **Better analytics**: Track usage patterns separately

## Important Notes

- **User Credits** are general purpose (1:1 with USD)
- **Radium Credits** are specialized and more expensive
- Users can buy Radium with either money OR User Credits
- Conversion rate: ~4 User Credits = 1 Radium Credit
- Both credit types are non-transferable between users
- Admin can adjust either credit type independently
- Full audit trail maintained for both systems

## Next Steps

1. Run database migration
2. Update existing `/api/credits` endpoints
3. Create new Radium Credit endpoints
4. Update UI components
5. Test payment flows
6. Deploy to production
