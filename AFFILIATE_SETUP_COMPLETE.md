## 🚀 Next Steps - What You Need To Do

### 1. Run Database Migration

```bash
# Make sure your DATABASE_PRISMA_URL is set in .env
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_affiliate_program
npx prisma generate
```

This will create all the necessary database tables and fields.

### 2. Integrate Commission Creation in Payment Processing

Add commission tracking to your payment webhook/handler. See `docs/AFFILIATE_INTEGRATION_EXAMPLE.md` for detailed examples.

**Quick example:**

```typescript
import { createAffiliateCommission } from "@/lib/affiliate-commissions";

// After successful payment
await createAffiliateCommission(
  payment.id,
  payment.userId,
  payment.amount,
  payment.subscriptionId
);
```

### 3. Configure Commission Payout Process (Optional)

Decide how you want to pay out commissions:

- Manual payouts via admin panel
- Automated payouts through payment processor
- Monthly/quarterly payment schedules

### 4. Test the System

1. **Test Referral Flow:**

   ```
   - User A logs in and gets referral link from /profile/affiliates
   - User B signs up using User A's link
   - Verify User B is linked to User A
   ```

2. **Test Commission Creation:**

   ```
   - User B makes a payment
   - Verify commission is created for User A
   - Check that User A receives notification
   ```

3. **Test Admin Functions:**
   ```
   - Log in as super admin (role 0)
   - Visit /admin/affiliates
   - Update User A's commission rate
   - Verify new rate applies to future commissions
   ```

### 5. Customize Settings (Optional)

**Default Commission Rate:**
Currently set to 15%. To change:

- Update the default in `prisma/schema.prisma`: `commissionRate Decimal @default(15)`
- Run migration after changing

**Program Terms:**
Edit the terms in `app/profile/affiliates/AffiliatesDashboard.tsx`:

```typescript
<ul className="text-sm text-blue-800 space-y-1">
  <li>
    • You will receive <strong>{data.commissionRate}%</strong>...
  </li>
  // Add or modify terms here
</ul>
```

**Cookie Expiry:**
Change referral cookie duration in `app/auth/signin/SignInForm.tsx`:

```typescript
// Currently 7 days (60 * 60 * 24 * 7)
document.cookie = `ref=${referralCode}; path=/; max-age=${60 * 60 * 24 * 7}`;
```
